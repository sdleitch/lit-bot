# lit-bot
A Twitter bot to slowly tweet the contents of long text files (books)

It splits the text file you feed in first by sentences, then into smaller, managleable chunks sutiable for Twitter. It tries its best to split the text in places (usually punctuation) which makes sense, but it's not perfect.

Mostly just a fun project I tried.
