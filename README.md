# lit-bot
A Twitter bot to slowly tweet to contents of long text files (books)

It splits the text file you feed in first by sentences, then into smaller, managleable chunks sutiable for Twitter. It tries it's best to split it places which make sence, but it's not perfect.

Mostly just a fun project I tried.
